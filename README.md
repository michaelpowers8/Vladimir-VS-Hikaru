# Vladimir-VS-Hikaru
This is a detailed analysis on the interesting posts regarding Hikaru Nakamura's recent success on chess.com, and his achieving of 3336 blitz rating. The data acquired was NOT from Hikaru's account. Rather, I took the time to create a simulation of results of varying ELO's of Hikaru versus other opponents. The results are incredibly fascinating.\n\n
